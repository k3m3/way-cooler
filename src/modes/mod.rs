//! Way Cooler exists in one of several different "Modes"
//! The current mode defines what Way Cooler does in each callback.
//!
//! The central use of this is to define different commands that the user can
//! run.
//!
//! For example, when the lock screen mode is active the user can't do anything
//! other than send input to the lock screen program.
//!
//! We also allow users to define their own custom modes, which allows them to
//! hook into the callbacks from Lua. In the `CustomLua` mode, callbacks do
//! the same thing as they do in the `Default` mode, but at the end of will
//! always execute some custom Lua code.
